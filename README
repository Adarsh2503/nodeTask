run the server using npm start

Task 1.

Open code and go to route/index.js
router.get('/save_all_agent') : is to save all agent names
router.get('/save_all_useracc') : is to save user account  
router.get('/save_all_users') : is to save all user details
router.get('/save_all_policy_category') : is to save all plolicy category
router.get('/save_all_policy_carrier') : is to save all policy carrier i.e  company name
router.get('/get_all_policy_carrier') : get methd for policy carrier
router.get('/get_all_agent') : get all agent names
router.get('/save_all_policy_info') : save policy info

get policy details with respect to username

router.get('/policy/:username') : pass the username in params

get aggregated policy 

router.get('/aggregatedPolicy') : get the aggregated policy details

collection name : agents, policycarriers,policycategories,policyinfos,
user1,useraccounts

Task 2:

1. for(var i = 0, len = cpus.length; i < len; i++) {
  console.log("CPU %s:", i);
  var cpu = cpus[i], total = 0;

  for(var type in cpu.times) {
      total += cpu.times[type];
  }

  for(type in cpu.times) {
      console.log("\t", type, Math.round(100 * cpu.times[type] / total));
  }
}

It will give us the result of cpu usage in percentage and the i can check if its more than 70% then i will just run a child 
process which is process.exit(1); and try to restart the server

2. open code goto route/posts.js file

router.post('/post') : Created a post-service that takes the message, day and time in body parameters 
and it inserts that message into DB at that particular day and time

collection name : post1

 for body parameter {
    msg: "something in msg",
    date: "30-04-2020",
    time: "10:22:31"
}
